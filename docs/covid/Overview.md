## Welcome to the COVID19 Surviellance Tool Technical Guide

#### Overview

The COVID19 Surveillance system can be found here: [http://hmis.gov.ls/covid19](http://hmis.gov.ls/covid19)


This system is built off of DHIS2's Tracker Module. All of the broader user manuals can be found [here:](https://dhis2.github.io/dhis2-docs/master/en/user/html/dhis2_user_manual_en.html)

#### Training Instance
We have also have a training instance which we try by all means to make it an up-to-date replica of the live system.
It can be found here: [http://197.155.193.109:1010/](http://197.155.193.109:1010/)
