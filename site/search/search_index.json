But please remember to drop SQL views before creating your dump You can go ahead and read this to prepare your instance. Within a few minutes you should by now have your DHIS2 instance running. Warning use postgres as your user for the db. It poses security threats (yes) but it's easier to deal with PostgreSQL with that setup. Unless ofcourse you're a PostgreSQL ninja. Restoring Postgres Database As you saw from the previous step, your instance is running two containers with networking between them handled by Docker Compose. If you have a live connection to Postgres database, you can't drop and restore your db. Do docker ps to see all of the running containers. docker-compose ps also works fine. it's important to do this step first because docker-compose is going to name according to how you named the folder containing the docker-compose.yml as well as how you labeled them inside the file To do that, you have to kill the frontend DHIS2 container then restore the DB with docker container kill <name_of_dhis_container> Copy DB backup file into Postgres container with docker cp dhis_db_backup.sql <name_of_postgres_container>:/ Get into the container with docker exec -it <name_of_postgres_container> bash Switch account from root to postgres with su postgres and then launch the PostgreSQL interactive terminal with psql \\l to list all of the databases drop database dhis2; to delete the database create database dhis2 to recreate the database. But now it's empty \\q to the interactive terminal psql --username=postgres --dbname=dhis2 < dhis_db_backup.sql to restore all of data into the empty database. if the command ran succefully, you should see a trail of verbosely listed SQL commands processed Then the trail is done, do exit to exit the container Finally, start the container that we \"killed\" with docker container start <name_of_dhis_container>","title":"How To Prepare Docker Training Instance"},{"location":"covid/Indicators/","text":"........content coming soon......","title":"Indicators"},{"location":"covid/Overview/","text":"Welcome to the COVID19 Surviellance Tool Technical Guide Overview The COVID19 Surveillance system can be found here: http://hmis.gov.ls/covid19 This system is built off of DHIS2's Tracker Module.

It has been noticed that some of the backup services have some technical issues and therefore you are advised to double check the file size after restarting the backup service before removing and stopping the container. The other option you can manually backup facility database by yourself. Our automated deployment for mappings and serialized object comprises 5 steps: 0. Preparatory Steps SSH into the server with ssh openmrs@_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS First check to see if your server has internet connectivity with ping github.com If not try to check contents of resolv.conf in /etc/ by running the following command: cat /etc/resolv.conf.Normally you should see google.com nameserver pointing to its ip 8.8.8.8.Edit the file if name server is not configured in the file. Nameserver(all in lowercase) 8.8.8.8.Ping 8.8.8.8 or google.com.After you may ping github.com just to make sure you are able to get packets from github.com Then download all of the files need with git clone https://github.com/eRegister/docs.git The command above will create a folder called docs in /home/openmrs if you didn't change to another directory. All of files that need to be transfered to the server are in docs/scripts/mappingsscripts : concepts_restore.sh gitpull_bahmniapps.sh gitpull_concepts.sh gitpull_mappings.sh gitpull_serial.sh gitpullbahmniapps.service gitpullconcepts.service gitpullmappings.service gitpullserializedobject.service serializedboject_restore.sh Go to /development/ and create the following directories openmrs_reporting_release and openmrs_concepts_release and grant openmrs user permissions to own the files. Move the following files to /usr/local/bin/ and make them executable: concept_restore.sh , serializedobject_restore . Move gitpull_concepts.sh to /development/openmrs_concepts_release and gitpull_serial.sh to /development/openmrs_reporting_release/ , make them executable. Note Files are already on the server Caution PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE BACKED UP THE DB BEFORE EXECUTING THE STEPS BELOW!!! 1. Removing Current Container check the running container: docker ps Stop the container: docker stop openmrseregister Check that the container has stopped run docker ps and you should see an empty table Create a new image from the stopped container: docker commit openmrseregister omrsregrepo/bahmni_base:09082020 [ tag should be date at time of creating image ] you can check the newly created image with docker images Remove the container: docker container rm openmrseregister 2. Creating a Volumes and enabling services Now it's time to create a new container from the image we created earlier with: docker run -e container_name=openmrseregister -it -d --restart always -p 443:443 -p 80:80 -p 8069:8069 -p 8000:8000 --privileged --name openmrseregister -v /development/bahmni_config_release:/development/bahmni_config_release -v /development/dhisconnector_mappings:/development/dhisconnector_mappings -v /development/bahmniapps_release:/development/bahmniapps_release omrsregrepo/bahmni_base:06082020 /bin/bash Go to /development/ and grant openmrs user permissions to files in /development/dhisconnector_mappings and /development/bahmniapps_release Move gitpull_bahmniapps.sh to /development/bahmniapps_release and gitpull_mappings.sh to /development/dhisconnector_mappings , make them executable. Create local repo's in all directories in /development except /development/bahmni_config_release , with the following commands: git init , git remote add git origin https://github.com:/eRegister/repo_name test that you are able to fetch files from remote repo's by git fetch --all move all services gitpullmappings.service , gitpullconcepts.serivce , gitpullbahmniapps.service and gitpullserializedobject.service . Nagivate into /etc/system/system/ and type the following commands to enable gitpull_mappings.service , gitpullconcepts.service , gitpullbahmniapps.service , gitpullserializedobject.service sudo chmod 664 service_name sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable service_name Note when the service has been registered successfully you should see created sym link in /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/. 3. Configuring cronjob configure the cronjob to trigger the services everyday 7 am if our servers universal time is at UTC. to edit the cronjob do: sudo crontab -e if it's first time running the this command it'll probably ask you to choose the default text editor, please be kind enough to choose Nano as it's the easiest editor for most administrators. configure the script as shown below and then when the updates have been pulled successfully change the script to trigger services at 7:05 , 7:10 , 7:15 , 7:25 respectively. Do not change the command that trigger serialized object script */3 * * * * systemctl restart gitpullmappings.service >> /var/log gitpull_mappings.log */4 * * * * systemctl restart gitpullserializedobject.service >> /var/log/gitpull_serial.log */5 * * * * systemctl restart gitpullconcepts.service >> /var/log/gitpull_concepts.log */6 * * * * sudo bash /usr/local/bin/concepts_restore.sh >> /var/log/concept_restore.log 20 7 * * * sudo bash /usr/local/bin/serializedobject_restore.sh >> /var/log/serial_restore.log Wait for a while for cron job to execute the commands and check directories in development have updates from GitHub. For failed services refer to Automated Deployment Exit Codes to troubleshoot. 4. Restore database and create soft links Go to into a container and start mysql service. Connect to database server using no password mysql -uroot -p Initialise openmrs database and users by sourcing openmsq.sql file in container root directory, source openmrs.sql; Wait a moment for databases to be created and once the script is done quit or exit the database server and restart mysql. Restore facility database using the command mysql -uroot -ppassword openmrs; Go to /opt/openmrs/dhisconnector Remove mappings folder and create soft link to /development/dhisconnector_mappings/dhisconnector_mappings/mappings command: sudo ln -s /development/dhisconnector_mappings/dhisconnector_mappings/mappings/ mappings Exit the container and go to /usr/local/bin and run serializedobject_restore.sh Restart other services and openmrs the broswer to access openmrs admin page.

Creating a Volume create development directory sudo mkdir -p /development/bahmni_config_release change ownership of the new folder from root to openmrs with sudo chown -R openmrs:openmrs /development becuase the service is managed by openmrs user get into the directory with cd /development/bahmni_config_release configure gitpull services Note DO NOT use git clone initialise new local git repo: git init if you do ls -a you'll see a hidden .git to show that indeed the folder has been intialized connect local repository with remote: git remote add origin https://github.com/eRegister/bahmni_config_release.git download the latest commits to the repo: git fetch --all you should see a log of all the latest commits downloading now go to the home directory: cd ~ OR cd $HOME copy gitpull.service file: sudo cp gitpull.service /etc/systemd/system/ move gitpull.sh file: sudo mv gitpull.sh /development/bahmni_config_release change directory cd /development/bahmni_config_release/ make the script executable sudo chmod +x gitpull.sh and sudo chown openmrs:openmrs gitpull.sh check the contents of the script with cat gitpull.sh to make sure that it does git fetch --all and git pull origin master Nagivate into /etc/systemd/system/ and type the following commands to register gitpull service in system sudo chmod 664 gitpull.service sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable gitpull.service Note:when the service has been registered successfully you should see created sym link in /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/. 3. Configuring cronjob & Restoring database configure the cronjob to trigger the service Monday 9 am to edit the cronjob do: sudo crontab -e if it's first time running the this command it'll probably ask you to choose the default text editor, please be kind enough to choose Nano as it's the easiest editor formost administrators. configure the script to run within 2 mins just to make sure everything is running OK: */2 * * * * systemctl restart gitpull.service >> /var/log/gitpull.log2>&1 inside the crontab editor write: * 7 * * mon systemctl restart gitpull.service >> /var/log/gitpull.log2>&1 Go to /development/bahmni_config_release/ and check the status of cron service to see when it has executed gitpull. service, once done check the file by typing ll or ls. For some reason you may find that the service has not pulled the files from our remote repository, first thing to do is to check the status of the service if it has successfully started. If not check the status code of the service to guide you what might went wrong. The following table shows possible exit codes of the systemd service. Another possible reason it could be that you forgot to change the ownership of the development bahmni config release, check it. EXIT CODE SYMBOLIC NAME DESCRIPTION 0 EXIT_SUCCESS Generic success code 1 EXIT_FAILURE Generic failure or unspecified error(try to start the development/bahmni_config_release afresh directory ) 200 EXIT_CHDIR Changing to the requested working directory failed 208 EXIT_STDIN Failed to setup standard input 209 EXIT_STDOUT Failed to set up standard out 203 EXIT_EXEC The actual process execution failed. Most likely this is caused by a missing or non-accessible executable file Another possible reason could be that the service in unable to fetch from remote repository which is not related to systemd service, check the logs of the service by typing sudo tail -f /var/log/gitpull.log If gitpull service has pulled the bahmni config file then make a permanent configuration in cronjob to trigger the service every Monday 9am . inside the crontab editor write: * 7 * * mon systemctl restart gitpull.service >> /var/log/gitpull.log2>&1 Now it's time to create a new container from the image we created earlier with: docker run -e container_name=openmrseregister -it -d --restart always -p 443:443 -p 80:80 -p 8069:8069 -p 8000:8000 --privileged --name openmrseregister -v /development/bahmni_config_release:/development/bahmni_config_release -v openmrseregister:/openmrseregister omrsregrepo/bahmni_base:19052020 /bin/bash After the command above you should see a container called openmrseregister running If the container has started successfully there is no need to restore database just copy all .sql files to container root ./ and symbolic_creation.sh to /opt/openmrs into the new running container docker cp latestbackup.sql openmrseregister:/ To get into the container do: docker exec -it openmrseregister bash Change directory to /development/bahmni_config to check if the volume was created when starting a new container. You should see the bahmni config release files. Go to /var/www/ and run: sudo rm bahmni_config or unlink bahmni_config Type sudo ln \u2013s /development/bahmni_config_release/ bahmni_config Go to /opt/openmrs/ and make symbolic_creation executable and run it Start MySQL service: service mysqld start Restore all sql copied sql files visit_type.sql , patient_identifier.sql , openmrs_global_property.sql and serial object.sql Start other services openmrs , httpd and bahmni-reports Browse to http://IP_of_eRegister/bahmni/home and check if the changes have been effected.

For version 0.92, please refer to guide here This document attempts to standardize how we prepare our servers to be ready for deployment at health facilities. Before we follow the steps on how to prepare the server, we first have to install Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS from Ubuntu Site Installing Docker To install Docker, please follow the instructions detailed in https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04 these instructions above were written for Ubuntu 16 but work perfectly for Ubuntu 18 Pulling the docker image and running it as a container In situations of poor internet connectivity where we're committing and sharing images using sneakernet, please follow the guide in here To pull the docker, it's not necessary to login from the terminal, just run the following: docker pull omrsregrepo/bahmni_base:25012020_release After the image has been pulled you should be able to see it when you do docker images A container is a running instance of an image. The last step is to run our image to make container with docker run -e container_name=openmrseregister -it -d --restart always -p 443:443 -p 80:80 -p 8069:8069 -p 8000:8000 --privileged --name openmrseregister -v openmrseregister:/openmrseregister omrsregrepo/bahmni_base:25012020_release /bin/bash To check that indeed we have a container running, you can do docker ps . Navigate into the container using the command, docker exec -it openmrseregister bash Once you have landed into the container, make sure that you're in the / directory and then start mysqld service with services mysqld start , login to a database without a password and then run the command below: source openmrs.sql After running the command above, do use openmrs and then do source OpenMRS_Start_up_Schema_V1.sql Starting Services Often times, we're going to encounter situations where a container is running but the services inside the container are not, to start your services running the following commands in this order: service httpd start service mysqld start service openmrs start service bahmni-reports start Now you should be able to see eRegister when you browse to http://server_IP/bahmni/home. you'll use the IP address of your server Enabling/Disabling Locations Depending on the health facility where the server will be deployed, we'll have to either enable or disable locations in the database. To do all of these, it is highly recommended that we run all of our sql queries through phpMyAdmin and shy away from using CLI. Browse to http://192.168.8.10/mydb and use the following credentials. remember to use your IP address username: password: On the left pane, you'll see a list of databases, click on openmrs . All of the locations are managed by a location table. If for example you're in Motebang Hospital, to see all of the locations for Motebang Hospital, run the following query: SELECT location_id, name, retired FROM location WHERE name LIKE '%mote%' 1 is for when retired is TRUE and 0 is when retired is FALSE . To enable locations we have to set retired to 0 . * So it will be done with the following UPDATE query: UPDATE location SET retired = 0, WHERE location_id=121; to enable Motebang Hospital * So it will be done with the following UPDATE query: UPDATE location SET retired = 0, WHERE location_id=122; to enable ART Corner Motebang Hospital * ...and so on and so fourth... ## Configuring Backup CONTENT LOADING....","title":"eRegister Installation Manual"},{"location":"ereg/intro/#eregister-installation-manual","text":"Warning this guide is for Bahmni eRegister 0.90.

We can start by taking a backup of the database with docker exec -it openmrseregister mysqldump -uroot -p openmrs > openmrs.sql . This command will create the backup inside the container but put the sql file outside the container. Then we can commit the running container to take a snapshot of it as is with docker commit openmrseregister omrsregrepo/bahmni_092:18052021 you can use whatever date when doing this for your tag Before moving forward with the steps below, please make sure you have both the sql file and the docker image with ls -lh . The file openmrs.sql should be more than 100M, if in doubt, you can do cat openmrs.sql to see the file has content. Also do docker images and make sure you can see the image you just created. To prevent conflicting ports, we have to finally stop and kill the container with docker stop openmrseregister and remove it completely with docker rm openmrseregister Warning Please don't skip this step. It's very important to do the backup before upgrading!!! Installing Docker The hosting should already have docker installed, but if for some reason it's not installed, please refer to this guide Please go as far as installing docker only and then come back to this guide. Installing Docker Compose To upgrade to version 0.92, we're going to use Docker Compose we're using more than one container. To install Docker Compose, copy and run the following: sudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Then make the binary file you just downloaded executable with the command below (copy and paste) sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Check that everything is running well by running docker-compose version and you'll see something like this: docker-compose version 1.28.2, build 67630359 docker-py version: 4.4.1 CPython version: 3.7.9 OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.0l 10 Sep 2019 If you don't see anything, you might want to do su $USER to reload enviroment variables then do docker-compose version again. Installing Git Do git version to check if Git is already installed. If it's not, run sudo apt install git Setting up containers Fig 1 - eRegister Bahmni 0.92 Diagram Preparing containers Go to home directory with cd ~ Download the repo with docker-compose file: git clone https://github.com/eRegister/bahmni_docker.git Change directory into docker_docker folder with cd docker_docker Start the containers with docker-compose up -d make sure you have internet connectivity because docker-compose is going to try do download the images to your serve After running the command abover, While still in $HOME/docker_docker , run docker-compose ps to check if the containers without any errors. You should see something like: Name Command State Ports -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- bahmni_docker_emr-service_1 /usr/sbin/init /usr/sbin/i ... Up 0.0.0.0:33062->3306/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8050->8050/tcp, 8053/tcp bahmni_docker_erp-service_1 /usr/sbin/init /usr/sbin/i ... Up 0.0.0.0:8069->8069/tcp The above output is also important as it shows names of the two containers created. Now we need to restore out backup into the new instance we just created by: copying openmrs.sql into the bahmni_docker_emr-service_1 with docker cp $HOME/openmrs.sql bahmni_docker_emr-service_1:/ get into the bahmni_docker_emr-service_1 container with docker exec -it bahmni_docker_emr-service_1 bash run ls and you should see openmrs.sql get into the MySQL database with mysql -u root -p then enter password run show databases and you should see a list all databases which include a database called openmrs . delete the openmrs database with drop database openmrs recreate the database again with create database openmrs get into the database with use openmrs . Before running the command below, make sure you're in the (blank) openmrs database by running select database() and you will see a small table that confirms that indeed you're in the openmrs database. restore the backup with source openmrs.sql Then run bahmni -ilocal start to start services and daemons that Bahmni depend on. Go to /var/www/ and run: sudo rm bahmniapps or unlink bahmniapps do sudo ln \u2013s /development/bahmni_apps_release/ bahmniapps do sudo ln \u2013s /development/bahmni_config092/ bahmni_config_ Browse to http://IP_of_eRegister/bahmni/home and check if the changes have been effected. Check that the system is running by browsing to http://SERVER_IP and you should see the new Bhamni 092 system as shown below: Fig 2 - eRegister Bahmni 0.92 After Upgrade Configuring Automated Deployment 0. PREPARATORY STEPS SSH into the server with ssh openmrs@_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS First check to see if your server has internet connectivity with ping github.com Then download all of the files need with git clone https://github.com/eRegister/docs.git The command above will create a folder called docs in /home/openmrs if you didn't change to another directory. All of files that need to be transferred to the server are in docs/scripts/: gitpull_bahmniapps.service gitpull_bahmniapps.sh openmrs_global_properties serialized objects symbolic_creation.sh Visit_types.sql etc. 1. CREATING A VOLUME create development_emr directory sudo mkdir -p /development_emr/bahmni_apps_release change ownership of the new folder from root to openmrs with sudo chown -R openmrs:openmrs /development_emr because the service is managed by openmrs user get into the directory with cd /development_emr/bahmni_apps_release 2. CONFIGURE BAHMNIAPPS SERVICES initialise new local git repo: git init (Do not use git clone) if you do ls -a you'll see a hidden .git to show that indeed the folder has been intialized connect local repository with remote: git remote add origin https://github.com/eRegister/bahmniapps092beta.git download the latest commits to the repo: git fetch --all you should see a log of all the latest commits downloading now go to the home directory: cd ~ OR cd $HOME copy gitpull_bahmniapps.service file: sudo cp gitpull_bahmniapps.service /etc/systemd/system/ move gitpull_bahmniapps.sh file: sudo mv gitpull_bahmniapps.sh /development_emr/bahmni_apps_release change directory cd /development_emr/bahmni_apps_release/ make the script executable sudo chmod +x gitpull_bahmniapps.sh and cat check the contents of the script with cat gitpull.sh to make sure that it does git fetch --all and git pull origin autobuildmaster Nagivate into /etc/systemd/system/ and type the following commands to register gitpull service in system sudo chmod 664 gitpull_bahmniapps.service sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable gitpull_bahmniapps.service Note when the service has been registered successfully you should see created sym link in /etc/systemd/system/defacat ult.target.wants/. 3. CONFIGURING CRONJOB configure the cronjob to trigger the service Monday 9 am to edit the cronjob do: sudo crontab -e if it's the first time running this command it'll probably ask you to choose the default text editor, please be kind enough to choose Nano as it's the easiest editor for most administrators. configure the script to run within 2 mins just to make sure everything is running OK: */2 * * * * systemctl restart gitpull_bahmniapps.service >> /var/log/gitpull_bahmniapps.log2>& inside the crontab editor write: * 7 * * mon systemctl restart gitpull_bahmniapps.service >> /var/log/gitpull_bahmniapps.log2>&1 Go to /development_emr/bahmni_apps_release/ and check the status of cron service to see when it has executed gitpull_bahmniapps service, once done check the file by typing ll or ls. For some reason you may find that the service has not pulled the files from our remote repository, first thing to do is to check the status of the service if it has successfully started.
